## Overview

This project aims to build models that can predict the category of news articles and their click-through rates based on the article titles. The dataset used for this project is the Microsoft MIND News dataset, which consists of a collection of news articles and user impression/click behaviors. 

This project is part of a larger initiative that leverages machine learning models and generative AI to create an automated pipeline for converting new research produced by leading universities into easy-to-digest blog posts.

PyTorch Lightning was chosen as the model training framework and experiment tracking was achieved using MLflow.


## Project Structure
